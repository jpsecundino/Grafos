Welcome to Automatic Sentence Generator!
In this program, you can generate sentences based on any static english dictionary and in any set of words.
You can check what your favourite writer would say if he/she had the specified set of words in mind.
You also can use it in your cellphone as it complete your sentences based on your own personal dictionary.

How to compile it?
    Just go to the main.c file path in terminal and write 'Make' whitout the quotes.
How to run it?
    You only need to specify the name of the dictionary file, wich has to be in the same folder,  as an
    argument in command line. See the example below:
        ./AutomaticSentenceGenerator myDictionary
    OBS:
        You can write a optional second argument, a double containing a value for the word penalty.
        This argument will set a penalty for every new word found on the actual sentence and it's used to avoid
        repeated words in final result. 
    Example:
        ./AutomaticSentenceGenerator myDictionary 2.5
Remember: 
    A larger dictionary implies better results! Enjoy and have fun \0/.
